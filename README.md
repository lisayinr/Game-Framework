# Overview

This is a 2D arcade-style game designed to demonstrate how to build an application using Python and Arcade library. This game is a reimagined version of Space Invaders where the player controls a wizard fighting off monsters with magic giving it its name: Wizard Invaders. The player moves left and right and casts spells to hit and destroy approaching enemies. The monsters also attack, and the game continues until the player loses all lives, defeats all enemies, or an enemy reaches the bottom of the screen.

The purpose of this software is to demonstrate how to build a simple video game using Python. It demonstrates the use of sprites, sounds, and keyboard interaction.
